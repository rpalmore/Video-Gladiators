Video Gladiators
----------------------------------------------------------------
Using the YouTube api we selected a playlist of nostalgic viral videos. You will battle a friend through a series of rounds by guessing the year the current video being played was uploaded to YouTube. Players will login through facebook and be placed in the battle arena.

Include a one or two screenshots of main UI/UX points of your app and how it solves a problem

The UI/UX if filled with animations and style updates to notify the players that the web app is going through a series of function. We have a login page where when a player logs in and then loads a "welcolm 'player' waiting for player 2". when a second player joins there is a timer to start the game to notify both players to be ready when so. There is a win count and loss count with a modal for the end declaring the victor of the battle. Other UI/UX include styles that notify the players if you answered correctly and when new videos are being loaded.
